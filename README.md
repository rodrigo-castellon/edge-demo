# Barebones React App

Just wanted a simple barebones React application boilerplate that:

- Can transpile
  - Specifically because JSX
  - But also so you can use the latest JavaScript features
- Uses [sourcemaps]
- Uses [Hot Module Replacement][hmr]
- Can build a basic production `dist/` output for easy deployment
- Doesn't have a bunch of unnecessary dependencies

## Required Software

- [npm] version 6.4.1 or above
- [node] version 10.13.0 or above

## Getting Started

1. `npm install` - to install the dependencies
1. `npm run dev` - to run the application in dev mode (using webpack-dev-server)
1. Open up http://localhost:3000 to view the app
1. Open up `src/App.js` and hack away. Hit save and enjoy the magic!

## Other useful commands

- `npm run dist` - to generate the production version of the application's script(s)
